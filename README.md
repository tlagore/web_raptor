### web_raptor ###

## Purpose ##
web_raptor is a project that I am designing in order to improve my understanding of sqlalchemy, python,<br/>
and alembic while producing something useful. The concept is to create a web scraper using python to obtain <br/>
useful information regarding some field and to store this information in a well formed database created using <br/>
sqlalchemy for futher analysis. Any migrations and changes are to be written in alembic.

If there is time and the project is enjoyable, it would also be ideal to add an interface to the database<br/>
using a framework such as django or flask.

## Installation ##
Ensure you've got a properly named virtual environment then use pip install -r requirements.txt.<br/>
I will update this section as requirements are added.<br/>
